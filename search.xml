    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This is a simple instruction of how I built this blog with all the references. HEXOThis blog is based on the framework Hexo powered by Node.js. It is very powerful with various plugins, themes, and easy to be deployed to GitHub. See detail on Hexo page THEMEThe original theme of this blog is called Ocean. Click here to see on GitHubClick here to see author’s blog page(含中文Theme教程) Tutorial LinksAn easy and quick-to-start way is to follow Hexo Documentation. Youtube video tutorial is provided on this site.If you are looking for a more detailed instruction, I recommend Hexo build bolg tutorial posted nmask’s blog.

This note is based on text book Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (7th edition) written by James Kurose and Keith Ross. What is the Internet? Hosts = end systems Communication links fibber, copper, radio, satellite transmission rate: bandwidth(bits/sec) Packet switches routers &amp; switches Internet: Interconnected ISPs Protocols: e.g., TCP, IP, HTTP Internet standards: IETF, RFC Network Structure Network edge hosts: clients and servers Access networks: wired/wireless communication links Digital Subscriber Line(DSL) dedicated Cable network shared Home network Enterprise access network (Ethernet) Wireless access network wireless LANs 802.11 b/g/n(WiFi) wide-area wireless access Cellular: 3G,4G(LTE),5G Physical media guided media: twisted pair copper wire, coaxial cable, fiber optic cable unguided media: radio links Network core packet switching store and forward queuing delay and loss two key function: routing &amp; forwarding circuit switching(telephone networks) FDM &amp; TDM Internet structure ISPs (Internet Service Provider) PoPs(Points of Presence) multi-homing peering IXPs(Internet exchange points) “tier-1” commercial ISPs (e.g. AT&amp;T) — global ISPs Content provider ISPs (e.g. Google) — private network Delay,loss,throughput in networks Delay dnodal = dproc + dqueue + dtrans + dprop dnodal: total nodal delay dproc: nodal processing dqueue: queueing delay dtrans: transmission delay = packet length / link bandwidth dprop: propagation delay = distance of physical link / propagation speed Packet loss: packet arriving to full queue dropped Throughput rate (bits/time unit) at which bits transferred between sender/receiver instantaneous throughput average throughput bottleneck link: min(Rc,Rs) Protocol layers and Encapsulation Application layer — Message Transport layer —– Segment Network layer —— Datagram Link layer ———— Frame Physical layer Network Security Malware virus: self-replicating infection by receiving/executing object (e.g., e-mail attachment) worm: self-replicating infection by passively receiving object that gets itself executed (e.g., vulnerable sw, network) spyware malware infected host can be enrolled in botnet (a network of private computers infected with malware), used for spam or DDoS attacks Attacks Dos, DDoS Packet sniffing IP spoofing]]></content>

    <url>%2F2019%2F03%2F31%2Fnew-post%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This is a tutorial about how to create a new post, draft or page on hexoNote that all posts are Markdown files. Click here to learn Markdown syntax. Create a new post:$ hexo new postnameBy default, the Markdown file postname.md created by this command will be under \source\_posts. You can change default create path by editing default_layout in the file _config.yml: # Writing new_post_name: :title.md # File name of new posts default_layout: post # Change it to another page name you have under \source titlecase: false # Transform title into titlecase external_link: true # Open external links in new tabCreate a new draft:$ hexo new draft draftnameIn stead of typing the postname, type out draft followed by draftname to create a new Markdown file called draftname.md under the path \source\_draftsDifferent from the post files, the new draft file just created will not show up on the web. If you want your _drafes folder to show up, you can run a special command with hexo server: #Note that you&apos;ve shut down hexo server $ hexo server --draftTo publish the draft to new post, namely, move the draftname.md file from _drafrs to _post(actually it depends on what is set todefault_layout). Type command: $ hexo publish draftnameCreate a new page:$ hexo new page pagenameHexo allow user to create a new page other than _post the blog post page. Since the new page is not a blog post, it is not going to get rendered on the home page as a blog post. If you want to access it, you need to append /pagename/ directly to your homepage URL Others (to be updated): To change template of post files, edit files under the scaffolds folder Tag Plugins instruction To insert an image on specified position in an article]]></content>
